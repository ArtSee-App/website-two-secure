        <h1>Journey of ArtVista (at least so far)</h1>
        <p>I'm writing this blog to tell the story of ArtVista,how it began, how it evolved, and how we got here.</p>

        <h2>December 2022</h2>
        <p>It's hard to recall, not going to lie, but if I'm not mistaken, Taylan texted me (Tunahan) about an idea,something like ArtVista. I believe it was after he visited a museum in Belgium, where they didn't provide proper explanations for the artworks in English, despite charging quite a hefty price for tickets.</p>
        <p>Back then, ChatGPT-3 had just been released (literally a few days old), and there wasn't a good solution for this kind of thing. Your only option was to take a picture and upload it to Google Translate. Obviously, nobody wants to do that.</p>
        <p>At the time, I was working part-time at a small startup, writing machine learning algorithms to match CVs with job descriptions. I was already deep in technical stuff, so when Taylan brought up the idea, I told him I could probably build a basic version of it,a working prototype in a Python notebook,in about 10 days. I also thought it'd be a nice portfolio piece since I was close to graduating, and honestly, the idea made sense in my head. Shazam for artworks.</p>
        <p>What I thought would take 10 days… oh boy, I was wrong.</p>

        <h2>March 2023</h2>
        <p>It took me roughly 4–5 months to build a properly functioning notebook file (which, by the way, is open-source). In the process, I had to learn a lot about computer vision and other parts of machine learning. Once we had a working demo, that was it,we were basically done. We had no intention of turning this into an actual product.</p>
        <p>Nothing much happened after that... until,</p>

        <h2>September 2023</h2>
        <p>Vlad joined the team. At this point, the three of us had known each other for four years,we started university together and somehow always stayed in touch. Maybe even a bit too much.</p>
        <p>Neither Taylan nor I had front-end development experience. AI wasn't as advanced then to just "build the app for you," so we asked Vlad for help. We figured he'd say no, but he made the mistake of saying yes. That day, the core team of ArtVista was born.</p>
        <p>Our first name was ArtSee,simple and clear,but due to legal reasons, we had to drop it. Then came ArtNet, as in a network for the art world. That didn't work either. Eventually, Taylan suggested the name Vista, which means "a pleasing view" or "outlook." And so, ArtVista was born.</p>

            </figure>
        <p>Finding the right logo, learning Figma, and building an actual app took us another 4–5 months. Vlad had made apps before, but not at this scale. I had built backends before, but again,not at this scale. I was also working full-time, so my time was limited to after-hours and weekends.</p>
        <p>The backend complexity was on another level. In my previous job, I wasn't doing anything remotely this challenging,and honestly, I don't think even the senior engineers were. ArtVista, both in terms of backend (servers, software) and frontend (app, website), was the most difficult technical project we'd ever worked on. And this is without touching the business side.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which,this isn't a charity. We had to make money to keep servers running and tech alive. Taylan was doing his best in Eindhoven, but nothing was happening until...</p>
        <h2>February 2024</h2>
        
        <p>Taylan had a random meeting at The Gate, Eindhoven. I don't remember the exact context, but since we studied at TU Eindhoven, and The Gate's whole mission is to support TU/e (and nearby schools') student startups, we figured it was worth talking to their business developers.</p>
        <p>That's when we met Bart, the lead business developer. He convinced us to join the TU/e Contest,a startup competition designed to help students take their ideas seriously. At this point, we already had a working app, but we weren't fully invested in the competition.</p>
        <p>We got convinced.</p>
        <p>We got better at pitching. But we were also in a ring full of competitors trying to save the world with rocket science. And here we were, an art-tech startup. Still, we truly believed (and still do) that we had the most tangible, realistic product,ready to use.</p>
        <p>Through the contest, we met Isolde Hallensleben, the Art & Tech Lead at TU/e's Innovation Space. It's wild that it took us 1.5 years to find out she even existed. She ended up being a key figure in our journey,connecting us with museum directors and other people in the art industry.</p>

        <h2>June 2024</h2>
        <p>We won the ASML Makers Award, which gave us the money to officially start our company: Vista Technologies.</p>
        <p>Soon after, we applied to DigitalOcean's Hatch program, got accepted, and received funding support for our infrastructure. We were on cloud nine.</p>
        <p>However, Bart was right saying "The journey isn't over yet, don't get too comfortable."</p>

        <p>We thought the hard part was over. It wasn't. Now we had to publish the app, market it, reach out to museums, convince them to give us their data, expand the ArtVista database, and somehow keep ourselves afloat financially.</p>
        <p>We thought it'd be easy.</p>
        <p>Again,oh boy, we were wrong.</p>

        <h2>December 2024</h2>
        <p>We were tired. Burned out. The Dutch winter wasn't helping either.</p>
        <p>We were close to landing some deals, but for some reason, they all fell through at the last minute. We didn't have the budget to market the app properly, and motivation was low. Vlad and I were also a bit bored,there weren't many new challenges.</p>
        <p>So we pivoted.</p>
        <p>We opened up ArtVista to artists,any artist can now upload their own artwork. That decision led us to build something new:</p>

        <h2>May 2025</h2>
        <p>The ArtVista Portal was done.</p>
        <p>But downloads were still meh. That's when we realized how important marketing actually is. This blog? It's part of that.</p>
        <p>Now, we're finally seeing decent growth. Most apps get launched, see a spike in downloads, and then vanish. That's the norm,99% of apps.</p>
        <p>In our case, we barely got any downloads at first, even though we posted on Reddit, shared on socials, and tried our best. Then something shifted,we still don't know what. Maybe someone wrote about us, maybe we hit a small viral wave. But downloads are climbing.</p>
        <p>And that's exciting,because we believe downloads can lead to more ratings, and better ratings will carry us even further.</p>

        <p>If this growth continues (and I truly believe it can), we'll start monetizing,not through ads or paywalls (we hate those too), but through small, meaningful upgrades. For example, letting users message the AI art guide more frequently for a small fee.</p>
        <p>Because at the end of the day,we're not hypocrites. We don't want to ruin the experience with things we ourselves despise.</p>

        <h2>Long story short</h2>
        <p>
        We’re definitely not done with our journey yet,slowly but steadily, we’re moving forward. We’re extremely proud of our product and can’t wait to see what comes next.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our hope is to attract more artists to the platform and to convince museums to partner with us.
        </p>
        <p>
        We believe exposure is crucial for both emerging and established artists, and if we can help them in any way, it would mean a lot to us. Moreover, audio guides today often fall flat: they’re not interactive or personalized, can be too expensive for no clear reason, and usually lack broad language support. We’re on a mission to change all that.

        <p> Thank you for reading and I truly hope you believe in our cause and mission. Even if not before, I hope you do now after reading this blog post. Thanks for being a part of our journey. </p>
        </p>

        <p style=" font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;">Best regards,</p>
